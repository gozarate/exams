<h2>Career</h2>

<p>
Jonaxx joined the online teen forum TeenTalk on the website candymag.com (the online affiliate of Candy magazine, published by Summit Media), and she posted her work on “Creative Corner,” a TeenTalk subsection dedicated to poems and stories way back 2003. In November 2012, acting on an old tip from one of her readers, Jonaxx signed up on the online writing platform Wattpad to call out a user who had plagiarized one of her works. She then became the first Filipino writer to be verified by Wattpad and was followed by Allen Lau on the platform. In March 2017, she ended her Pop Fiction run with the release of an entire trilogy, the Baka Sakali Trilogy, which was launched in one of the biggest book signing events by a single author by a local publisher. Summit Books held the book signing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filoil_EcoOil_Centre"> Filoil Flying V Arena</a>.
